#ibm blocks
class="block-text "skip
class="block-statement" skip

class="blocks-tabs"?

class="block-flashcards" flip cards
class="blocks-accordion" open all acoordions
class="block-labeled-graphic" open lables
class="continue-btn brand--ui"click the continue button

class="block-knowledge"
aria-label="Knowledge check: Multiple choice"
aria-label="Knowledge check: Multiple choice"a
aria-label="Knowledge check: Multiple response"

prompt
so each noOutline has one of the following classes in the div in it 
they may be more than this
class="block-text "
class="blocks-accordion" 
class="block-statement" 
class="block-flashcards" 
class="block-labeled-graphic" 
class="blocks-tabs"

 but for now lets concentrate on the 
ones that need interaction

class="blocks-tabs" open all tabs
class="block-flashcards" flip cards
class="blocks-accordion" open all acoordions
class="block-labeled-graphic" open lables
class="continue-btn brand--ui"click the continue button

and 
class="block-knowledge"

now we have sub categories of block-knoledge below 
each block knowledge has either of the two 

aria-label="Knowledge check: Multiple choice" auto answer with  radio
aria-label="Knowledge check: Multiple response"auto answer with  checkbox


now i need a script another one for this case based of the previous one we made 
instead of random scrolling 

we should go from one noOutline to another highighting each category 1second delay then moving on to the next 
if its not among the important ones lets just say general

but if it has one of the classes above and their subcategories higlight it where we used the counter 
so  where the counter was we could have 

tabs-open all tabs 


and if its the knowledge class 
we just say "knowledge -answer with radio "
or " knolwledge -answer with checkbox"


part 2:
Now i  need a new script for this second step i want another script that is more robust from this script 
so intead of just highlighting the classes i want you to execute some functions for the interactive classes 

so lets start with 

class="block-flashcards" execute Notdone/Autoflipcards_IBM.js once(not trepeatedly )
class="blocks-accordion" execute Notdone/Autoaccordion_IBM.js once(not trepeatedly )
class="block-labeled-graphic" execute Notdone/AutoOpenLabled_IBM.js once(not trepeatedly )
class="continue-btn brand--ui"execute  Notdone/skillsautoclickcontinue_IBM.js once(not trepeatedly )
class="block-knowledge"execute Notdone/Autoranomanswer+Next_IBM.js once(not trepeatedly )


<button class="continue-btn brand--ui" data-continue-btn="" type="button"><div class=" brand--linkColor"><div class="fr-view rise-tiptap">Next</div></div></button>

part 3

i need some changes 
so instead of retying 
1 i need you to resort to scrolling down to the bottom of the page like we do here pagewrappagescroll_IMB.js
and then try picking up the noOutline inview 

so that is the first thing if it fails 
second if we try clicking this  button 
<button class="continue-btn brand--ui" data-continue-btn="" type="button"><div class=" brand--linkColor"><div class="fr-view rise-tiptap">Next</div></div></button>
in the noOutline in view 

then we go back to retrying if all that fails 

we do not need to go back to the previous  noOutline as we implemented it earlier 
lets just use the noOutline in view 

next change
instead of waiting for 1 second  
id prefer a feed back from the selected function ie if the function returns executed we move on to the next noOutline
